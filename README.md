# DevelopingDataProduct-Project
This repo has the Shiny App as part of the project in Developing Data Product course. Following Dr. Caffo's simple example of diabetes risk calculator, a shiny app body mass index (BMI) calculator is developed. It needs to input body weight and body height and outputs BMI and risk.

For the app, following files are created:
ui.R
server.R

The shiny app can be found in the following link:
